# Code Coverage Report

## Summary
- Total statements: 120
- Covered statements: 44
- Missed statements: 76
- Coverage percentage: 37%

## Details
Coverage generated by pytest-cov on main.py.

### Covered Lines
- App initialization and DB setup
- Git command execution (run_git_command)
- Commit handling (handle_commit)
- History display (show_history)
- Test logic and assertions

### Missed Lines
- UI composition (compose method)
- Button press handlers (on_button_pressed)
- Key event handlers (on_key)
- Input submission (on_input_submitted)
- Screen and widget setup

## Why Low Coverage?
TUI code depends on Textual's runtime environment. Unit tests mock UI interactions, but full coverage requires integration tests or extensive mocking of Textual internals.

## Commands
- Run tests with coverage: `python run_tests.py`
- View HTML report: `open htmlcov/index.html`
- Terminal report: `pytest --cov=main --cov-report=term`

## Improvement
To increase coverage:
- Add mocks for Textual widgets and screens
- Use e2e testing with Textual's Pilot (requires setup)
- Test UI event flows

Current coverage sufficient for core functionality validation.
